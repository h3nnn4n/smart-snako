Over time I have build a set of linters, checkers and other tools that I find
very helpful to use when working with pure C code. This repository contains a
basic setup of those tools on a very simple application.

It has the following set up:
1) clang-format (Code style)
2) clang-tidy (Linter)
3) cppcheck (Linter)
4) cpplint (Linter)
5) gproftools (Heap checker)
6) Valgrind (Heap checker)
7) Unity (C Unit Testing framework)

It also has a smoke test CI stage that simply runs the executable with a few
different args. This is mostly to check that it at least runs and exits
properly.
