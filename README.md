This is a basic snake implementation, with several build in agents. The following agents are available:

- `random`: Moves in a random direction, but never in a direction where it
  would kill itself. Unless there is no option.

- `manhattan`: Moves in a straight line to the cherry. If it doesn't have line
  of vision it moves randomly until it dies or estabilishes line of sight
  again.

- `raw_hamilton`: Follows a pre-calculated path which visits all cells exactly
  once. If the grid size is odd numbered in the rows and columns (e.g. 5x5 or
  7x11) a halmitonian cycle won't exit. In this case a cycle is generated with
  exacly one cell left out. If the cherry spawns in this cell, an alternative
  cycle is used.

# References

So cool references to look into:

They inspired me into researching this further.

# Usage

Clone and build using `make`. `--verbose` shows up what is happening. `--width`
and `--height` can be used to customize the board size. Some statistics are
logged into `stats/`.

Use `--agent` to set an agent to run. So far the following are available:
`random`, `manhattan` and `raw_hamilton`.
